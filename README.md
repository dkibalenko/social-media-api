# Social Media API

## Introduction

This project is a RESTful API built with Django and Django REST Framework
for a social media platform. It allows users to create posts, like posts,
follow other users, and manage their profiles.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication with JWT**: Users register their
  accounts and create profiles. They obtain a JWT token for authentication.
  On logout the refresh token is blacklisted.
- **User Profile Management**: Users can create and manage their profiles with
  adding bio, birth date, phone number, and profile image. They can search other
  users by username, first name, and last name.
- **Authorization with permissions**: Only authenticated users allowed to
  perform actions like creating posts, liking posts, manage and delete their
  own profiles, and following/unfollowing others.
- **Follow/Unfollow**: Users can follow and unfollow other users. They can get
  a list of their followers and followees.
- **Like/Unlike**: Users can like and unlike posts. They can get a list of
  liked posts as well as the list of their own posts. Users can add comments to
  posts.
- **Post Management**: Users can create and manage their own posts with images,
  retreive a list of all posts. They can filter posts by hashtags and author's
  username.
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images for their posts.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Endpoints are documented with requests and
  responses examples.
- **Scheduled Post Creation**: With Celery and Redis, users can schedule posts
  to be created at a specific time.
- **Clean Blacklisted Tokens as a periodic task**: With Celery Beat,
  users can set periodic tasks to clean blacklisted tokens.
